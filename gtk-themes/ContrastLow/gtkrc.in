# Low-Contrast Theme v0.1
# This is the whole basic theme, just this one gtkrc file.
# It uses components of the standard theme engine
# Written by Bill Haneman, based on Standard theme by T. Liebeck, 
# which was in turn based on lots of different gtkrc files but
# primarily the one for the metal theme.
#
# Low-contrast icons by tigert.
#
# email: bill.haneman@sun.com


# Note: this theme is deliberately using the icons from the
# ContrastLowLargePrint theme at the moment, until we have
# some hand-crafted icons at a smaller size to use here. -CB.
