The Menta theme comes with 3 different panel.rc files in
gtk-2.0/widgets folder.

-- panel.rc for light grey  panel background (default)
-- panel-dark-grey.rc for a dark grey panel background
-- panel-black.rc for a black panel background

You simply edit the gtk-2.0/gtkrc file to choose your
favorite background.
Example for choose a black panel background.
