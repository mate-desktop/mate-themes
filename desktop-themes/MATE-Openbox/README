This theme is based on Wolfgang Ulbrich's "BlackMATE" theme, which did not work
for me because a lot of text was invisible. While I was modifying the theme I
started experimenting with its look, since css files seem to allow a lot more
control than legacy gtkrc. This is the current outcome (of course it is a work
in progress). The gtk2 version seems to work well with Gimp, Golly, Inkscape and
VLC. The metacity theme is copied from BlackMATE (with minimal adaptations).



Note that elementary-icon-theme-2.7.1 (https://launchpad.net/elementaryicons),
which I prefer because of its beautiful icons, needs some fixes to work with
MATE:

To fix the cache generation failure (that folder only contains duplicates):
sudo rm -r /usr/share/icons/elementary/status/48/untitled\ folder

Fix missing and wrongly sized icons:

More size hints for index.theme may be needed.

elementary-icon-theme-2.7.1 could use a lot more fixes: many related icons (mime
type icons with the same background and a different overlay image) are different
sizes and not properly aligned. I don't know how important this is though; the
difference is visible only when viewing the icons in an image viewer in rapid
succession. The current elementary theme (4.0.3) pays attention to this issue
(see http://elementary.io/docs/human-interface-guidelines#iconography). But this
theme also needs to be patched for missing icons. It should suffice to add
"Inherits=mate,Adwaita,hicolor" or maybe "Inherits=gnome,Adwaita,hicolor"
to index.theme and rerun gtk-update-icon-cache.

Also try "human" and "oxygen". All these are more colorful and readable than the
grey-on-grey mate, gnome and Adwaita themes.

The following is Wolfgang Ulbrich's original README:



WORKAROUNDS

Like it's the case with other dark themes, there may be readability issues in LibreOffice and also in webpage input fields when seen with Firefox or Epiphany. Fortunately, there are workarounds:

LibreOffice
============
The first issue can be fixed by changing "OOO > Tools > Options > LibreOffice > Appearance > Document background" to white after disabling automatic detection of high contrast in Accessibility.

Firefox
========
To fix the second issue for Firefox, create '~/.mozilla/firefox/<YOUR_PROFILE>/chrome/userContent.css' with these lines in it:

/*------------ start ------------*/

input, textarea, select {
	-moz-appearance: none !important;
	background-color: white;
	color: black;
}

a[class="file"],
a[class="dir"],
a[class="symlink"] {
	color: #2EB8E6 !important;
}

a:visited[class="file"],
a:visited[class="dir"],
a:visited[class="symlink"] {
	color: #FF6666 !important;
}
/*------------- end -------------*/

Also, create '~/.mozilla/firefox/<YOUR_PROFILE>/chrome/userChrome.css' and paste these lines in it:

/*------------ start ------------*/

.autocomplete-richlistbox richlistitem .ac-url,
.autocomplete-richlistbox richlistitem .ac-separator {
	color: #2EB8E6 !important;
}
/*------------- end -------------*/

Seamonkey
==========
Do the same thing for Seamonkey. The difference is just your profile folder, which is inside '~/.mozilla/seamonkey/'.

Thunderbird
============
The same as above but inside Thunderbird's profile folder.

Epiphany
=========
Take control of Epiphany by selecting "Use custom stylesheet" in "Preferences > Font & Style" and creating '~/.config/epiphany/user-stylesheet.css' as:

/*------------ start ------------*/

select {
	color: #fff !important;
	border-radius: 0 !important;
	border-color: transparent !important;
}

input {
	background-color: #fcfcfc !important;
	color: #000 !important;
}
/*------------- end -------------*/

Meld
=====
Just for more readability, you could change #880000" to #e60000" in '/usr/lib/meld/meld/tree.py' but this isn't necessary.

Liferea
========
Go to or create '~/.liferea_X.Y/liferea.css' (X.Y is the version of Liferea) and add this to it:

table.headmeta {color: #fff;}
#errors, #commentFeedError {
	color: #000;
}

Ubuntu Software Center
======================
Find the following definitions in '/usr/share/software-center/ui/gtk3/css/softwarecenter.css':

@define-color light-aubergine
@define-color super-light-aubergine

Then, change their values to #4D4D4D and #3B3B3E respectively, i.e.

@define-color light-aubergine #4D4D4D;
@define-color super-light-aubergine #3B3B3E;
